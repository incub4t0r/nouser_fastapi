# FastAPI NoUser

This is an update to the original nouser repo. Instead of flask, this is written with FastAPI. 

The code that exists within this repo is essentially a boilerplate template.

# Sessions

Using FastAPI, we can add session middleware from starlette and provide each visitor a 2 week default cookie.
